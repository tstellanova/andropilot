* Hide OF_LOITER, TOY_A and TOY_B modes because no one seems to use them
* Fix an autobug

# 1.9.10
* ac3.1rc5 now reports gps, magnetometer and rc radio faults - Speak announce such faults (thx Randy)
* Run speech daemon in the background - this allows speech notifications while
phone is asleep in your pocket.
* Spend a bit more time with power profiling.  Using a more efficient version
of the mavlink code saves a lot of battery.  A Nexus 7 should now be able to
log for almost 2 hours per charge.
* Fix more minor autobugs

# 1.9.09
* Fix a couple of minor/rare autobugs

# 1.9.6
* Support 'spectator/read-only mode'.  The new 'Read Only' menu item will switch Andropilot into a mode where it _never_ sends packets to the vehicle.  This is useful for vehicles that only have a one-way radio link

# 1.9.5
* Support the new px4 USB device IDs (reenables direct USB connection to Pixhawk) (Thanks for the report Tridge)
* Support VERY small screens (320x240) with a special UI (move bluetooth options into menu etc...) (Thanks Rory San Miguel)

# 1.9.3

* Lower AHRS data download rate when HUD is not up - to save battery & bandwidth
* Use a higher position download rate - for higher resolution tlogs/map view
* Support the new MAV_CMD_DO_SET_CAM_TRIGG_DIST command
* If the vehicle has never been armed, don't show the home icon until it has been so armed... (prevent user confusion with arducopter)

# 1.9.2
* The new style 3dr radios (shipped with Iris) would not be auto recognized by Andropilot on the first plug attempt (you had to plug them in a second time).  Fixed.
* If you enable GCS scripting (alpha test) in the settings, you will now have a spiffy new user extensible checklist window (Simon's proposed layout - but most code not hooked up)

# 1.9.1
* Cope nicely with radios that are dropping many packets (thanks to Glenn McLelland for in depth debugging on this)
* Promptly send files to droneshare (if so configured)
* Static content is now served for the beginnings of user runnable checkists and vehicle control scripts.  If you turn this feature on and go to http://localhost:4404/static/README.html you should get an interesting response ;-)
* Add support for simulating very high error rate links (crappy rctimer radios ;-))


# 1.9.0
* Fix bug that broke loading waypoints from files (thanks to Antonio Alfaro)
* Include new scripting API (not yet documented - off by default)
* Fix a couple of rare autobugs
* Fix a bug where the new radiation warning could fail on screen rotation of certain tablet types (non fatal - but ugh)

* Add support for 'show on map' for big waypoint lists

# 1.8.17
* Warn about periods of high solar activity (thanks to NOAA for the data and ligi@ligi.de for a reference implementation).  The app will warn when first launched, or if you choose the new "Solar activity check" menu item.
* Include sysid for up to three vehicles in the tlog filename

# 1.8.15
* Use param by value to fetch params (I had turned this off a long time ago because old AC builds didn't support this).  Now that those old <2.93 builds are gone I can turn this back on - MUCH FASTER PARAMETER DOWNLOADS - especially for bluetooth!  (Thanks to Stefan and Peter for asking for this)
* Fix problems where new state machine would get confused if you attached to a vehicle that was already
half way through downloading parameters.

# 1.8.14
* Fix bug where parameter updates wouldn't show up until you moved at least two tabs away from the parameters
tab.  This bug was introduced in 1.8.01, much thanks to Brendan O'Reilly for the great 'steps to reproduce'.
* More support for javascript vehicle control (no UI yet)

# 1.8.04
* Make a new UI that is optimized for small phone screens - it should look pretty nice (if cramped once you turn on screen joysticks) - thanks to Remigijus (in Lithuania!)
* Allow the various SimpleUI buttons to scroll if necessary for small screens
* Fix the problem of the service not exiting - introduced in the last release.  Thanks Gary and Luciano for the reports

* First cut of new 'even simpler' UI
* Misc improvements to the RC joysticks (I've been flying with only the tablet lately)
* (Alpha) support for multiple vehicles (though not yet shown in most views) - No configuration needed, just attach multiple 3dr radios to a (POWERED) USB hub
* Beginning of scripting support 
* The sidebar pane is now dockable - just use the menu to turn it on/off

# 1.7.13

# 1.7.12
* Known bug: using 'gestures' to slide between screens may cause hangs with this version of the app - for this beta
please just use the screen names at the top of each tab to switch...
* Add (basic) support for Pebble watches (go to 'music' inside your watch - this is a temporary home for this proof of concept)

# 1.7.10
* Fix problem introduced where we'd drop the vehicle link occasionally (thanks to beta testers Gary and Luciano)
* Add extra debugging (and change a suspected error to be non-fatal) if the new state machine gets confused
* Don't let vehicles arm if the are not at zero throttle (Thanks to Dave C for reporting this important safety issue)
* Sometimes the AC claims it is flying when it is disarmed, silently deal with this problem...

* When connected by bluetooth, show proper vehicle state on the icon
* Make popup modal bar appear in correct position on portrait 7" displays

* Okay - that was fast.  A clean fix is now in for the hack of a fix in 1.0.03.  Parameter display should be reliable again.

# 1.0.03
* Ouch - 0.2.01 introduced a nasty crash which would occur the _second_ time the parameters list was two screens away from the current screen.
This release is a quick patch to fix that problem.  However, there is still a problem that sometimes the parameter screen can show up blank.
Until I fix this more minor problem, just rotate the tablet and the parameters screen will be okay.

* Default autocontinue to true for new waypoints
* Previously we only kept the screen on if the map was shown, we now do it if any screen is shown
* Previously if you switched to the waypoints or parameters view too quickly they would never update - fixed

# 0.1.36
* Spiffy new Quad icons contributed by Scott Berfield.  Thanks Scott!

* Speak "Heartbeat lost" if we lose vehicle comms
* Show mode as "unknown" if we don't have comms
* NOT YET READY FOR TESTING: 'Lead-it' mode.  Like follow-me, but if you rotate the vehicle will stay in front (or behind you), if you tilt tablet fore and back it will move close or away.
